    "description": "Nexleaf Black Carbon Filter Analyzer measures black carbon concentration in the air. It uses a quartz fine-grade filter, on which black carbon particulates from air-pumped smoke settle on. Using a special reference card to calibrate for different lighting conditions and camera configurations, a user will snap a picture of the exposed filter using any cell phone camera and send it to the server where it's further processed to determine the concentration of black carbon in the air.",
